# Changelog

### 0.4.2

- Fixed: Mass is scaled when it shouldn't be in `bouncing.py`, `permanence.py`, `containment.py`, `shadow.py`, `stability.py`, and `toy_collisions.py`.
- `tdw_physics` now requires TDW v1.11.3.0 or newer.

## 0.4.1

- Added `mass_scale` parameter to `RigidbodyDataset.get_add_physics_object()`

## 0.4.0

- Moved `PhysicsInfo` class and `PHYSICS_INFO` dictionary to `tdw_physics.physics_info`

## 0.3.1

- `tdw_physics` now requires TDW v1.8

- Fixed code examples in the README 

## 0.3.0

- Added a function to reshape the `_depth` pass in order to stay compatible with TDW v1.7.15 (the `_depth` pass is now far more accurate).
